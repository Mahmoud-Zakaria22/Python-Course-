Temprature=25
if Temprature>=30:
    print("It's a hot day. Stay hydrated!")
if Temprature>20 and Temprature<29:
    print("It's a warm day. Enjoy the weather!")
if Temprature>10 and Temprature<19:
    print("It's a cool day. Wear a jacket!")
if Temprature<10:
    print("It's a cold day. Stay warm!" )
